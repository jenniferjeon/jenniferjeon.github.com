            My theme is what have i thrifted? This blouse is a vintage blouse originating from the 70s? I’ve been thrifting for almost two years now and
            this is one of the first things that I’ve ever thrifted. I thrifted this in London when I was studying abroad and it really sparked my interest 
            in thrifting. Something that might be mysterious about this image might be - what is this blouse’s story? where has it been? Thrifting has allowed
             me to have a sustainable hobby while also curating my individuality and developing my personal style.

            My partner, Michelle, is doing her project on video games. For her image, she chose to draw all of them. She says:
            "This character is named “Luminous”, from the game Maplestory. I have always loved playing video games so I’m doing my project 
            on the collection of my favorite games, and Maplestory played a big part in my life. Maplestory helped me socialize, as I have always 
            been a shy and timid person. I’ve made countless of friends in that game and I’m glad to have been able to face my social anxiety through 
            Maplestory. I also like to draw, so I wanted to combine both art and video games together, and I want my collection to show my love for both."

            <a href=”wedesigndemand.com”> We Design Demand </a> is an experience by Digital Surgeons, a creative consultancy
             based in the United States. It shows the capabilities, core values, and advertises the services of this consultancy. 
             This website uses compelling images, interactions prompted by the user scrolling, and adheres to a sleek, clean visual identity
              that captivates the user and persuades the user to utilize their services. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Specifically, I found the scrolling interactions to be quite delightful; In some interactions, as the user would 
              scroll, a marble bust would continuously break into pieces. In addition, in another part, the scrolling action would allow for an in-site scroll 
              within a sketch of a desktop or a mobile interface, showing the capabilities of their ux design skills. To use the space effectively, sometimes a vertical scroll 
              would scroll horizontally instead. Overall, it was super cool to scroll through this website and see how Javascript works to trigger certain actions with a scroll.

        <h2 class = "title"> Response 2: Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows</h2>
        <h3 class ="date"> 01/27/2020</h3>
        <p class = "text-entry">
            Overlays are used especially to draw a user's attention while they scroll on a website. Maybe they are used
            to prompt the user to sign up for a newsletter, or they can be used to show relevant information. The overlay 
            can be quite annoying at times; however, its original intention was interestingly enough used to solve a UI
            problem.

            <br>
            <br>
            In her medium article <a href=https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c> 
            Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows </a>, Naema Baskanderi goes over best practices in using modals and overlays
            so as to not annoy the user too much. Indeed, she encourages the designer to avoid using the modal as they do tend to interrupt
            the user flow and impede user interaction. She encourages the user to think about when to use the modal, how to show the modal, 
            and what information should be presented and collected. She emphasizes the importance of not using modals to show error messages,
            and to make it as easy as possible to complete the prompted task in the modal (or to close the modal!). She also touches on the importance
            of accessibility when designing modals: keep in mind of keyboard accessibility and be sure to incorporate that into the design.

        <h2 class = "title"> Response 1: Best Practices for Form Design </h2>
        <h3 class = "date"> 01/20/2021 </h3>
        <p class = "text-entry"> 
            Forms permeate our life. Whether it be in the form of ballots voting for elected officials
            or filling out an order form to purchase Girl Scout cookies, forms are valuable ways of collecting
            information from masses of people. However, they can be quite annoying to fill out,
            especially if they are long and require multiple responses.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, as product designers, we are tasked with making forms as accessible and usable as possible.
            Salim Ansari enumerates in his article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"> Best Practices for Form Design</a> 20 different ways forms can be
            both more usable and easy to navigate. His article not only focuses on the UI of forms, but also on the
            wording on the form itself. It is important to consider visual hierarchy and to avoid harsh designs that
            may deter the user. In addition, he emphasizes the importance of decreasing the cognitive load
            and to focus on relevant information to encourage users to complete the form. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, it is important to consider accessibility and usability not only in forms, but in all aspects
            of user experience. As forms can be quite a pain point for users, it is important that product designers focus
            their attention on making such forms more accessible to all users.
