    <h1> Project Brief </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> The goal of this project is to emulate Go-Stop, a traditional Korean card game. </p>
    <h2> Comparison Project 1</h2>
    <p> The first project I looked at is <a href="playingcards.io">Playingcards.io</a> which is a virtual platform in which users can 
    play various card games with their friends. I played around with various card games offered here, such as go fish and 500. One thing I noticed
    was the amount of visual and audio feedback received when a user made a move or wanted to know more about their status. In addition, 
    the playing environment was very much like how it would be in real life. In addition to this, the instructions are delinated at the beginning
    and users can refer back to them at any time. </p>
    <h2> Comparison Project 2</h2>
    <p> The next project I looked at was at an online poker game. At first, I tried to look for online Go Stop games but I couldn't find any
    that my browser could support because of the lack of Flash support. Thus, I decided to look at an online Poker game as Go Stop is also
    commonly known as Korean Poker. The one I looked at specifically was <a href="247freepoker.com"> 247 free poker</a>. Some things I noticed
    were the inclusion of chips and other props also incorporated in the games. One thing I will consider in my game is also adding additional
    props to further make it more realistic.   </p> 
    <h2> Project Goals </h2>
    <p> This project will be an iteration and built further upon the "Game On" project. With this project, 
        I hope to educate users about a card game that is beloved and important in Korean culture. 
        Design-wise, I hope to practice interaction design best practices and be able to effectively communicate
        visually the essence and the competitive nature of this game. 
    </p>

    <h2> Design Strategies </h2>
    <p> In terms of the design, I want to make it as similar as possible to the game in real life. This means
        having the background be a dark green color to mimic the traditional blanket that is used to play
        go-stop on, using the traditional colors of the cards of muted reds, yellows, and blues. As this is an extension of the 
        "Game On" project, I will be illustrating some more cards on Illustrator to get a more cohesive experience. On the left 
        side of the interface, there will be a column of a contrasting color that explains the game in more
        detail and explains the significance of the game. 
    </p>
    <h2> Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>In terms of interaction, I am thinking about using the timer to exactly keep up with the flipping and unflipping of cards.In addition,
        I will be sure to incorporate visual feedback, whether it be overlays or an alert, to keep the players aware of the current status of the game.
        I would also love for the game to be played with two players, and so that players can choose which cards they play. 
    </p>
    <h2> Experience Goals </h2>
    <p> As mentioned before, I would want to expose users and my audience to this traditional Korean game. I would try to emulate
        the real game as much as possible, using sound effects and hover states specifically to mimic card behavior.
