            <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is will draw a card, which has a specific numeric value. 
                The value of the card is added to the current player's score, unless either card comes up as a "one". If this happens, 
                this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each card draw, the current player can either draw the card again, 
                (assuming a "one" was not drawn) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. 
                The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</p> 
            <p>Oh, and if you draw two "ones" (snake eyes), your current score gets zeroed out. So don’t do that.</p>
