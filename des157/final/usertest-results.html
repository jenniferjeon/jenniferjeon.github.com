    <h1> User Test Results</h1>
    <article class = "entry">
    <p> I got a lot of userful feedback from user testing! Overall, I got both positive feedback and some constructive criticism
        on my project that I plan on implementing.
    </p>
    <p> The main piece of feedback that I got was about the large amount of empty space I had within my game control board.
        All users I tested with reported that when they wanted to click on the "play" button, they had to scroll up in order to do so.
        One way I can improve this is to make sure that my width and height is set accordingly and find a way to account for this
        wit the overlay (which I am suspecting is the reason why it behaves like that). In addition, I got some feedback
        to increase the contrast between the typography and the overlay so that it is easier to see. I plan on incorporating
        this feedback by changing the colors of the overlay background and the font color so that it is easier to read. With this feedback,
        I will improve the readability and the interface of the game board.
    </p>
    <p> I also briefly talked with Professor Mead about my project! I think I will make it more culture-centric, and figure out ways
        to make that come out more strongly.
